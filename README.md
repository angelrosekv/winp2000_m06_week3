## Section 1: Linux History 
<div align="justify">
Linux is a well-known open-source operating system, first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Torvalds was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in Finland and started Linux as a personal project. The name Linux comes from a mix of his first name, Linus, and Unix, the operating system that inspired his work. Back then, most operating systems were costly and proprietary. Torvalds aimed to create one that would be freely available to everyone. He released Linux as free software under the GNU General Public License, allowing anyone to use, modify, and share his source code.
